# reecho
Now a days autoencoders is polpular in various field.  But, there is twoapplications  of  autoencoders  which  is  most  popular:   dimensionalityreduction and information retrieval.
* By using these features we can perform various image processing.* This project has four method of image processing
    * Generate Image
    * Noise Reduction
    * Constructing New Images
    * Colouring Images

#### Code File:
* All the code is used inside the reecho_model.ipynb notebook to run image processing.
* The autoencoder model is saved as variational_autoencoder.py.
#### Report:
* The report on this project is saved as report.pdf.
#### Run Test:
* To run test you need to run the test_model.py python file.
* Dowload the project and run the python file in the same directory
***
    python run test_model.py
***

#### Results:
* Although the result is not promissing but still the model works really well, under these circumtances (lower amount of data and lower training time)
* AThe original and reconstructed data in 'image reconstruction' model
